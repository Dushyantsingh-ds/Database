### [ACID properties:](https:github.com/dushyantsingh-ds/database/) 

BMS follows the concepts of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID). ACID properties help the database to maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure. 

### [Backups:](https:github.com/dushyantsingh-ds/database/) 

A backup is a copy of data from your database that can be used to reconstruct that data. Backups can be divided into physical backups and logical backups.

### [Replication:](https:github.com/dushyantsingh-ds/database/) 

Database replication is a technique through to copying data from a central database to another more databases location. It is useful in improving the availability of data and fault tolerance.
